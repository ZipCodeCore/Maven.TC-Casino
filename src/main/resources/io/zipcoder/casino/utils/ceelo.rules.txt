Cee-lo is played with three dice. The Banker rolls the dice
first, and either wins automatically, loses automatically,
or sets a point. If the Banker sets a point, the player rolls
the dice. The player either wins automatically, loses automatically,
or sets a point.

    Player point higher = Double money
    Banker point higher = No money
                    Tie = bet returned

How the  rolls are scored:

                4-5-6  : auto win
               Triples : auto win
                1-2-3  : auto lose
pair of non 1s and a 1 : auto lose
pair of non 6s and a 6 : auto win
     pair and a single : set the single as point

                Have fun, buddy!
