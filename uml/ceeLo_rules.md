3 x D6
player vs banker version
even money: $10 bet, player can win $10 or lose $10 (against the bank)
banker has roughly (2.5 x bet amount) advantage

RULES

1. banker rolls - 4 possible outcomes
    * Automatic Win: banker rolls 4-5-6, triples, or pair of non-6s + 6
        (straight kill, leopards)
    * Automatic Loss: banker rolls 1-2-3, pair of non-1s + 1
        (1-2-3 straight lose, asshole ones)
    * Set Point: banker rolls a pair and a single(2,3,4,5), then the single becomes the banker's "point"
        (2-2-4 gives the banker a point of 4)
    * Re-roll: if none of the above, reroll.
        (only auto-win, auto-lose, set point can end a turn)

2. player rolls (banker set a point of 2,3,4,5)
    * roll the dice to settle the bet against the banker
    * player wins with a 4-5-6, triple, or any point higher than the banker's
    * player loses with a 1-2-3, or any point lower than the banker's
    * if they push (tie the banker's point) no winner/loser, player pocket's their stake.
    * if no win, loss, or point is rolled, Re-roll
